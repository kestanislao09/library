# library
Libray project for intermediate JS Curriculum of Odin Project

This will be an exercise in creating, storing, and outputting objects into a screen. I will be making a point to avoid constructors and use factory functions to create this, despite factory functions not being introduced til the next lesson. Trying to keep as much as possible out of the global scope as well. Going to keep the html and css very minimal for the sake of focusing more on the Javascript side of things.

## Things That Need Doing
 - Write up the book factory function
 - Figure out the logic for using the form to add new books
 - Make sure the read toggle and delete button works.
 - Style things up

 ### Self-Imposed Extra Credit
 - Sort buttons?
 - Edit button?
 - Animated book cards
 - Save library to local storage
