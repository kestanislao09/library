# library
Libray project for intermediate JS Curriculum of Odin Project

This will be an exercise in creating, storing, and outputting objects into a screen. I will be making a point to avoid constructors and use factory functions to create this, despite factory functions not being introduced til the next lesson. Trying to keep as much as possible out of the global scope as well. Going to keep the html and css very minimal for the sake of focusing more on the Javascript side of things.

## Things That Need Doing
 - ~~Write up the book factory function~~ done 3/3/22
 - ~~Loop to display books as cards~~ done 3/4/22
 - ~~Figure out the logic for using the form to add new books~~ done 3/10/22
 - ~~Make sure the read toggle and delete button works.~~ done 3/10/22
 - Style things up

 ### Self-Imposed Extra Credit
 - Sort buttons?
 - Edit button?
 - Animated book cards
 - Save library to local storage

## Updates

### 3/3/22 0614
Spent the evening doing most of the planning in my notes. Set up the HTML boilerplate and made the first commit along with this README update. 

### 3/10/22 0427
Its been a hell of a week, but today (*and patially over the weekend*) we got alot of this stuff done. All the buttons are hooked up, all the logic has been figured out. Did some quick testing of things. Styling just needs to be done on some of the dom elements and a better color scheme is in order, but the javascript portions went quite smoothly.
